## what is morphnet??

morphnet is a sophisticated technique for neural network model refinement.  

MorphNet takes an existing neural network as input and produces a new neural network that is smaller, faster, and yields better performance tailored to a new problem.  

MorphNet optimizes a neural network through a cycle of shrinking and expanding phases
